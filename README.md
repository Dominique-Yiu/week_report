# 跬步千里

**Weekly Report.**

The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

## 2023/07/05~2023/07/12

### 概述

这周的工作主要集中在Stanford的一篇文章的上，需要对文章的一些实验进行一个复现，然后第二个就是要完全读懂文章和它对应的代码。

### 完成的任务

- 代码基本完全扫过一边，基本读懂了；花了大概两三天的时间。
- 完成了自己电脑环境的配置；大概一天
- 复现了文章提供的demo模拟实验；一个下午

### 进展和挑战

- XML物理环境构建，比较难阅读，这方面的基础比较差，需要进一步了解

- 现在思考Mujoco仿真到Issac Gym的转变

### 下周计划

- 对Learning Bimanual Manipulation这个任务的深度理解，能够提出问题，甚至是改进方法
- PowerPoint准备下周的group meeting.

### Summary

The work I focused on this week is to continue to explore the paper from Stanford. To comprehend it deeply, I read papers about BERT and DETR, whose idea is used in that paper. CLS token has a representation from the global information level, which can be used as downstream tasks. In this paper, CLS output is used as style variant, namely latent code. As for DETR, it's originally used in object detection. But here, its brief or easy structure has also great performance.

### Completed Tasks

- Understand why it uses BERT and DETR ideas to solve problems in that paper.
- Passed group meeting successfully.
- Watched RSS conference live stream replay, some paper in RL implementation.

### Challenges

- Is there any idea to improve the current performance?
- Is DETR the best structure to fit this environment?
- I still can't use Isaac Gym simulation platform to do some simulation tasks.

### Next Week Plan

- Simulate the environment that the paper said totally. Fix the camera problem, and environment issues.
- Continue reading the state-of-art papers.
